# FinePrompt: Unveiling the Role of Finetuned Inductive Bias on Compositional Reasoning in GPT-4
This repository contains the codes for the EMNLP 2023 Findings paper, (FinePrompt)[https://dfdf.com].
Our work deals with the idea of transferring task-specific inductive biases from finetuned models to prompts, as a way of improving GPT-4â€™s compositional reasoning capabilities.

## Setting Up the Environment
Since this work only deals with the effective prompting on GPT-4, our work requires the installation of the `openai` API.
```shell
pip install openi
```

## Prompts
The set of base and in-context prompts are provided in the `prompts.py`, and setting up the in-context samples requires the adoption code bases from the following works:
